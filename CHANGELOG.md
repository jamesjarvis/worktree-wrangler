## [1.5.0] - 2025-08-18

### üîÑ BREAKING CHANGE: Per-Repository Script Configuration

**MIGRATION REQUIRED**: Setup and archive scripts are now configured per-repository instead of globally.

### Added
- **Per-Repository Script Commands**:
  - `w <repo> --setup_script <path>` - Set setup script for specific repository
  - `w <repo> --archive_script <path>` - Set archive script for specific repository
  - `w <repo> --setup_script ""` - Clear setup script for repository
  - `w <repo> --archive_script ""` - Clear archive script for repository
- **Enhanced Configuration Display** - `w --config list` now shows all configured repository scripts with clear organization
- **Repository Validation** - Commands validate that the specified repository exists before configuring scripts
- **Improved Help Documentation** - Updated `--help` and `--config` to show new per-repository syntax

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Global script configuration (`w --config setup_script/archive_script`) is now **deprecated**
- Scripts are stored per-repository in `~/.local/share/worktree-wrangler/repos/` directory
- Each repository can have its own setup and archive scripts for maximum flexibility
- Configuration commands now provide clear migration guidance with examples

### Migration Guide
```bash
# OLD (deprecated):
w --config setup_script ~/scripts/setup.sh

# NEW (per-repository):
w myproject --setup_script ~/scripts/setup.sh
w frontend --setup_script ~/scripts/frontend-setup.sh
w backend --setup_script ~/scripts/backend-setup.sh
```

### Technical Details
- Repository scripts stored as individual files: `<repo>.setup_script` and `<repo>.archive_script`
- Same environment variables provided: `$W_WORKSPACE_NAME`, `$W_WORKSPACE_PATH`, `$W_ROOT_PATH`, `$W_DEFAULT_BRANCH`
- Backward compatibility maintained through deprecation warnings with migration examples
- Enhanced error handling with repository existence validation

## [1.4.0] - 2025-08-15

### Added
- **Setup and Archive Script Configuration** for automated worktree lifecycle management
- **`w --config setup_script <path>`** to configure a script that runs when creating worktrees
- **`w --config archive_script <path>`** to configure a script that runs before removing worktrees
- **Environment variables for scripts**:
  - `$W_WORKSPACE_NAME` - Name of the worktree
  - `$W_WORKSPACE_PATH` - Full path to worktree directory
  - `$W_ROOT_PATH` - Path to the root repository
  - `$W_DEFAULT_BRANCH` - Default branch name (usually 'main' or 'master')
- **Script execution during `w --rm`** and `w --cleanup`** operations
- **Enhanced configuration display** showing setup and archive script settings in `w --config list`

### Changed
- Extended configuration system to support executable script paths

- Improved error handling with clear messages for script configuration issues

### Technical Details
- Scripts run with working directory set to the worktree path

### Added
- **New `--copy-pr-link` command** for copying PR links with size-based emoji prefixes

- **Flexible usage patterns**: `w --copy-pr-link` (current directory) or `w --copy-pr-link <project> <worktree>` (specific worktree)
- **Cross-platform clipboard support** with automatic detection of pbcopy, xclip, or wl-copy
- **Enhanced tab completion** for the new --copy-pr-link command

### Changed
- Improved error handling: warnings instead of errors for non-worktree directories when using `--copy-pr-link`
